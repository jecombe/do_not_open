# Zama FHEVM — verified versions and deviations from the brief

Checked on 2026-09-30 against docs.zama.org (Protocol, Solidity guides, Relayer SDK),
the official `zama-ai/fhevm-hardhat-template` (v0.4.1) and the community
`0xE1337/fhevm-skill` SKILL.md.

## Versions for `packages/contracts-evm` (Phase 2)

| Package                   | Version   | Why this one                                        |
| ------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `@fhevm/solidity`         | `^0.11.1` | What the template and the Hardhat plugin peer on    |
| `@fhevm/hardhat-plugin`   | `^0.4.2`  | Template                                            |
| `@fhevm/mock-utils`       | `^0.4.2`  | Template                                            |
| `@zama-fhe/relayer-sdk`   | `0.4.1`   | Pinned exactly by the plugin's peer dependency      |
| `hardhat`                 | `^2.28.6` | The plugin peers on Hardhat 2, not Hardhat 3        |
| `ethers`                  | `^6.16.0` | Template                                            |
| Solidity                  | `0.8.27`, `evmVersion: cancun` | Template                       |

npm already carries `@fhevm/solidity` 0.13.3 and `@zama-fhe/relayer-sdk` 0.4.4, but the
current plugin does not declare support for them. Phase 2 starts on the template's set
and re-checks whether the plugin has moved before deploying.

APIs confirmed current: `ZamaEthereumConfig` (replaces the removed `SepoliaConfig`),
`FHE.randEuint64()`, `FHE.allow`, `FHE.allowThis`, `FHE.allowTransient`,
`FHE.makePubliclyDecryptable`, `FHE.checkSignatures`, `FHE.toBytes32`,
`instance.publicDecrypt(handles)`, `instance.userDecrypt(...)`.

## Where the brief and the protocol disagree

### 1. There is no on-chain decryption callback

The brief describes `observe` as "request public decryption, then a callback sets
revealed". `FHE.requestDecryption` and the oracle callback were removed in v0.9.

**What we do instead** (same pattern for observe, proveAlive and duel):

1. `observe(tokenId)`: checks, sets `observing = true`, calls
   `FHE.makePubliclyDecryptable` on the handles, emits `ObserveRequested`.
2. Off-chain, anyone calls `relayer.publicDecrypt(handles)` and gets cleartexts plus a
   KMS proof.
3. `finalizeObserve(tokenId, cleartexts, proof)`: permissionless. Rebuilds the handle
   list from storage, calls `FHE.checkSignatures`, stores plaintext, sets
   `revealed = true`.

The intermediate state and the duplicate-request guard from the brief still apply; the
"callback" is a normal transaction that anyone may send. The frontend sends it for the
user; a keeper can sweep stragglers.

### 2. ACL grants cannot be revoked

The brief asks to "stop allowing the previous owner" on transfer. `FHE.allow` is
permanent; there is no revoke.

This turns out not to matter, because of point 3.

### 3. The holder must not get blanket ACL at mint

The brief says "ACL granted to the holder" at mint and also "shake never reveals state
or rarityScore". Both cannot hold: an address allowed on a handle can user-decrypt it
directly through the relayer, without calling `shake`. A holder allowed on `state`
would simply read it.

**What we do instead**: at mint only the contract is allowed (`allowThis`) on seed,
state, traits, score and affection. `shake` creates a *fresh* handle holding the picked
trait and allows the caller on that handle only.

Consequences for transfers: there is nothing to move and nothing to revoke. The new
owner starts with no knowledge and shakes to learn. The previous owner keeps what they
already learned from their own shakes, which no system could take back.

### 4. Which trait a shake reveals

"Pseudo-randomly picked by the contract" has two possible meanings:

- a public index from block data: cheap, but the holder can see and grind it;
- an encrypted index from `FHE.randEuint8(8)`: the pick itself is hidden and cannot be
  ground. Costs five encrypted equality checks and four selects.

Phase 2 implements the encrypted pick and packs `(index, roll)` into one `euint16`, so
the viewer learns both the trait and its value from a single decryption.

### 5. Randomness bounds are powers of two

`FHE.randEuintXX(bound)` needs a power-of-two bound and encrypted `rem` is expensive.
The game spec therefore slices a 64-bit seed into bit fields and compares against
thresholds. State odds are exact to 1/65536 (see `packages/game-spec/README.md`).

### 6. HCU limit per transaction

A transaction is capped at 20M HCU (5M sequential depth). `mint(quantity)` is capped at
5 per transaction in the spec until Phase 2 measures the real cost per box; the
per-function HCU table will be documented there.

### 7. Solana

Zama's SVM support is announced, not shipped; nothing can be verified yet.
`packages/chain-adapter/solana` stays a documented stub until the SDK exists.
